# Super + Enter Open Windows Terminal
## Motivation
Because I don't really want to use Win + S and then type in Chinese to find the terminal, and I don't want to use Win + R to find wt to open it, so I wrote the Win + Enter method I am used to in Linux to open the terminal.

# Usage
Press Win + Enter to open Windows Terminal

# Subsequent optimization
If you find it annoying to click the exe again when booting the computer like I do, you can paste the file here
```
C:\Users\<You User Name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
Next time you turn on the computer, it will run in the background.
